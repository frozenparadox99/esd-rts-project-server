# RTS Project

## Abstract 
- Thermal power plants have a multitude of systems that need a very specific range of temperature and humidity in order to function. 
- A single deviation into suboptimal temperatures can disrupt the entire plantâ€™s yield. 
- This is a real time system that helps constantly keep check on a fluctuating industrial unit, by allowing all systems to work only when the fluctuations are below a specified threshold. 
- This involves the use of a dynamic prioritising software which can change the order in which it processes tasks based on the need of the time and temperature conditions.
- A simple function que-scheduling approach is used, with queue-based priority line up. 
- A handy addition to this project is the logging of temperature and humidity data to a website which enables maintenance of these plants by the touch of a button, remotely from anywhere in the world
